This repository consists of implementations of various machine learning algorithms I have learned to analyze complex datasets. For formatting datasets in a way that would make them easier to analyze, I used `pandas`, `numpy`, and `sklearn`.

## ML Methods Learned:
* Linear Regression
* K-Means Clustering
* Mean Shift
* K-Nearest Neighbours
* Support Vector Methods
